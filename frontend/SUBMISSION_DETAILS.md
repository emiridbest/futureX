# Hackathon Submission Details

## Project Name
Tradi - AI Prediction Market Oracle

## Short Description
Tradi is an AI-powered oracle for prediction markets that uses machine learning to forecast crypto price movements, helping users make informed decisions on Celo.

## Long Description
Tradi empowers the Celo ecosystem by providing a sophisticated data and prediction layer for prediction markets. 

**The Problem:**
Participants in prediction markets often lack the data analysis tools to make informed bets, relying on gut feeling rather than data.

**The Solution:**
Tradi combines:
1.  **Machine Learning Models:** TensorFlow and Scikit-learn models trained on historical data to predict future price movements.
2.  **Real-time Analysis:** Technical indicators and sentiment analysis to gauge market direction.
3.  **Conversational AI:** An intuitive chat interface where users can ask "What is the probability of BTC hitting $100k?" and get a data-backed answer.

**Integration with Celo:**
Tradi is designed to be the intelligence layer for Celo prediction markets. Future updates will include direct MiniPay integration, allowing users to place bets on Celo-based prediction platforms directly from the Tradi interface using cUSD.
